#Prog01: Create a program that ask user to input 2 numbers. Print the bigger number.
answer_a = int(input("Enter first: "))
answer_b = int(input("Enter second: "))
if answer_a > answer_b:
    print(" first is the bigger number")
elif answer_b < answer_a:
    print("second is the bigger number")

#Prog02: Create a program that ask user to input 2 numbers. Print "Equal" when the numbers are the same.
answer_a = int(input("Enter first: "))
answer_b = int(input("Enter second: "))
if answer_a == answer_b:
    print("Equal")

#Prog03: Create a program that ask user to input 2 numbers. Print the sum of the two numbers.
answer_a = int(input("Enter first: "))
answer_b = int(input("Enter second: "))

#Prog04: Create a program that ask user to input 2 numbers. Print the product of the two numbers.
answer_a = int(input("Enter first: "))
answer_b = int(input("Enter second: "))
print(answer_a * answer_b)

#Prog05: Create a program that ask user to input 2 numbers. Print the quotient of the two numbers with the decimal point
answer_a = int(input("Enter first: "))
answer_b = int(input("Enter second: "))
print(answer_a / answer_b)

#Prog06: Create a program that ask user to input 2 numbers. Print the result when the first number is raised to the second number.
answer_a = int(input("Enter first: "))
answer_b = int(input("Enter second: "))
print(answer_a ** answer_b)
