#Prog01: Create a program that ask user to input 2 numbers. Print the bigger number.
answer_a = int(input("Enter first: "))

if answer_a > answer_b:
    print(" first is the bigger number")

#Prog06: Create a program that ask user to input 2 numbers. Print the result when the first number is raised to the second number.
answer_a = int(input("Enter first: "))
