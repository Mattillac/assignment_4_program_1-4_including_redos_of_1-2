#Prog02: Create a program that ask user to input 2 numbers. Print "Not Equal" when the numbers are not the same.
answer_a = int(input("Enter first: "))
answer_b = int(input("Enter second: "))
if answer_a != answer_b:
    print(answer_a, "and", answer_b, "are not the same")
elif answer_a == answer_b:
    print("Both are equal")
